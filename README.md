Another practice project from Codecademy's full stack/front end section. Overall starting to feel 
more comfortable with utilizing flexbox, but I'd like to hone in on fine-tuning the responsive design
aspects. I couldn't figure out a way to have the location cards wrap properly when using the background
image in a div, so I ultimately left it as a static section.
